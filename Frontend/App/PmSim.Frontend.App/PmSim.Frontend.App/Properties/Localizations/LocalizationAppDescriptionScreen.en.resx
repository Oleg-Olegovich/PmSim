            Game Entities
            • Employee. Characterized by skill levels. The desired salary is formed depending on them according to the formula m * (sp + sm + sd + sma) / (4 * ms) + r; where m is the maximum salary (game constant); sp, sm, sd and sma are the levels of programming, music, design and management skills; ms is the maximum possible skill level (game constant); r is a pseudorandom number in the range [-1; 1]. The probability of successful hiring: (a / b) * 100%, where a is the salary offered by the player, b is the salary desired by the employee. It is impossible to return after dismissal. Every sprint requires a salary, even if it didn't work. It is possible to involve not only your own projects in the development, but also other players (by agreement). Takes the place of the office. An employee can perform the following tasks: project development; project backup production; project idea generation.
            • The player's game character. It is inherited from an employee and also occupies a place in the office.
            • Project. It is described by the name, deadline, necessary progress in each specialty (skill). Some, after implementation, give a one-time income, some permanent, some give a certain number of random opportunities as a reward. You can add features to some of them (additions to the main project that give a one-time or permanent income do not have a deadline). Ways to get: each turn 1 random project idea is given for free; buying a project at auction; give an employee a task to come up with a project idea, the probability of success depends on the skill of creativity. A project can have a backup that saves its progress. As a result of the use of some errors and incidents, the progress of the project is reset to its backup.
            • Office. It is characterized by the size (how many employees can work in it), the cost of rent and employment. It is possible to rent several offices.
            • Auction house. In it, players can trade between each other projects, opportunities and employees at auctions.
            • Opportunity. Gives either some advantage to the using player, or harms another.
            • Incident. It is inherited from the opportunity and represents a harmful opportunity that is used against all players if they collectively do not pay off.
            • Game map. Visible to all players, iterative objects of offices and auction house are located on it. When you click on an object, the corresponding menu opens.
            
            Rules
            • At the beginning of the game, the player chooses the background of his character. programmer, musician, designer, manager or major. Choosing one of the 4 professions will give a bonus to the level of the corresponding skill (the levels of the remaining skills will be equal to 1), choosing the last option will give a bonus to the starting capital. However, the majors do not work at the beginning of the game and do not receive a salary.
            • After all players have chosen their backstories, the main part of the game begins. It is divided into development sprints, and each sprint is at a stage. The stages follow each other in strict order. Each stage of the sprint is limited in time. The stage may end before its deadline if all players exhaust the number of their actions or press the skip turn button.
            • Management stage. At the beginning, all rents are paid. If a player has never rented an office and has not chosen the background of a major, then it is considered that he is still employed and receives a salary. At the same time, the player can develop projects with the efforts of only his game character. Also at this stage, the player can rent an unlimited number of offices (if the lease occurs for the first time, the player ceases to receive a salary until the end of the game), hire employees in the office, use the opportunities, give tasks to employees and his game character. To hire an employee, an interview is conducted in the office. During the interview, a random employee is generated, the player sees his parameters (skill levels) and offers him a salary. If successful, the employee is added to the office. For conducting interviews and using opportunities, points of available actions are spent, the maximum number of which is set in the game party settings.
            • The stage of diplomacy. In the auction house, the player can create a new public auction, a personal auction, participate in someone else's public auction or a personal one, if it was created for him. The public auction is held according to the English scheme: the auction lasts for a limited time; the bid only increases; the participant who offered the highest bid wins. In a personal auction, the seller can only raise the bid, the buyer can only lower it. If the buyer has never offered a bid in a personal auction, the auction is considered to have failed. Projects, opportunities and employees are traded at auctions. If the lot is a project or an opportunity, then it is removed from the seller and added to the buyer. If an employee, then this means leasing personnel for the next sprint (the seller will not be able to issue tasks to this employee during the sprint, but the buyer will be able to).
            • Between the stages of diplomacy and the incident, the results of projects and auctions are summed up. If the project is completed and a one-time reward has not yet been paid for it, then it is paid. Permanent income is paid for completed projects. If the project is incomplete and its deadline has expired, then it is removed from the player. For each auction, if it was successfully held, the winner is determined, who pays the bid and receives the lot.
            • The stage of the incident. Continuation of the diplomatic component of the gameplay. Each player is notified of a negative event common to all. It can be collectively bought off for a certain amount for each incident. The player can choose how much money from the available funds he will donate (0 can be donated). No one knows how much other players donate. If the amount is not less than the required amount, the incident is canceled. Otherwise, it is applied against each player (regardless of whether he donated money or not).
            • The winner is determined differently depending on the selected game mode. In the "Survival" mode, the last player who has not gone bankrupt wins. In other modes, the game expires after a certain number of sprints, the winner is the player with the most money or completed projects.</value>
